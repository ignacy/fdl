FDL (Fractious Device Logger)
==============

Logging is one of the most useful things when haunting for bugs.
But sometimes it's especially hard to log data - for example:
if we are working on a device with no storage, or if we can access
either log or the application itself at a given time.

In cases like that it would be nice to use a remote logging
solution. FDL is a remote logger designed to work
with fractious devices/software.

Features
========

* build on top of sinatra
* uses GET request (sometimes sending a POST is hard)
* auto refreshing
* has wrappers for Ruby, Java and JavaScript

Usage
=====

Install the gem:

    gem install fdl

Run the application

    fdl [run|clear]

Use your loger to send the messages to localhost:8181
You can view the newest log under http://localhost:8181/show
