FDL (Fractious Device Logger)
==============

Logging is one of the most useful things when haunting for bugs.
But sometimes it's especially hard to log data - for example:
if we are working on a device with no storage, or if we can access
either log or the application itself at a given time.

In cases like that it would be nice to use a remote logging
solution. FDL is a remote logger designed to work
with fractious devices/software.

Features
========

* build on top of sinatra
* uses GET request (sometimes sending a POST is hard)
* auto refreshing
* can maintain multiple logs at once
* allows to search, filter and save log data
* has wrappers for Ruby, Java and JavaScript


Usage
=====

1. run the application

    $> fdl -p 4567

2. configure logger to send log messages to http://host_ip:4567/log_name

3. Open http://host_id:4567/view/log_name with your browser, and you are ready to go!
